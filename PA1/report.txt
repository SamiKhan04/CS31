In step 5, by putting letters or integers larger then INT_MAX, the program produced nonsensical output.

The error I introduced in logic_error.cpp is when both the jasmine and basmati rice are equivalent, it always stated that 
"More people prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice." I fixed the error by making sure the program checks when both rice types are equivalent.

The two errors I introduced in compile_error.cpp is whe the user inputs a very large number for any of the integer variables or non-integers.
Both of these errors can be fixed with cin.fail() as this command takes the last cin value and checks if the type the value took it was 
what it was declared to be and if the value is not larger INT_MAX.
